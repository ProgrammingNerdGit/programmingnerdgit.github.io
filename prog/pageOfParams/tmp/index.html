            <h1>My issue:</h1>
            <p>My issue is the wave and extreme over saturation of misinformation that is broadly available on the internet and "Info" giving source.</p>
            <p>On the internet, news, books, ect... There is information that could be harmful.</p>
            <p>Example: Jilly juice, a "miracle drink that can regrow organs and limbs and even cure diseases such as cancer, and you can make it at home"</p>
            <p>(jilly juice contains large and lethal amounts of sodium that can also cause strokes)</p>
            <p>Jilly juice sounds like a very bad idea and overall a scam to us, but some people are very desperate do these thing hoping that they will work</p>
            <p>only to inevitably <b>DIE</b> or get worse condition's</p>
            
            <p>The moral of this is that misinformation can lead to very bad things.</p>

            <h2>Now how this relates to my identities and my values</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>As an information "Sponge" as I call it I am always gathering information, the problem with this is that wrong intentions can get into my head.</p>
            <p>This could lead into people like me having a problem with wrongful implicit bias.</p>
            <p>This normally happens when you don't know much about the subject at hand.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>well "how often does this happen" you may ask and that can be illustrated with this:</p>
            <p id='wave'>ok I was programming a wave interference pattern, and in programming you look up things all the time</p>
            <p>its just how it works even if your the best programmer in the world you still have to...</p>
            <p>I digress, I was having a problem with my script so i look up the issue and click on a trusted website</p>
            <p>and i see an add on the side about the 2016 election being rigged or somthing and i knew better then just to belive it so I look it up</p>
            <p>and i leeded to a website that was literely called "clubconspiracy.com" which is a website that people can exchange conspiracy theorys</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Its just the fact that you can find false or misleading infomation <b>anyware</b></h3>
